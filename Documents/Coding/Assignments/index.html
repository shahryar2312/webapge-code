                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>I am<strong> Kazi Shahryar Rahman</strong>. I am 21 years old. I am from Italy, but I was raised in Bangladesh as my parents are from Bangladesh. I completed high school in Bangladesh last year. Right now, I live near the Blackpool Shopping Centre.<br><br> I have been admitted to Griffith College for a BSc (Hons) in Computing Science. I look forward to preparing myself to get IT certification from CompTIA, Cisco, IBM, and Google. I will try my best to manage the time properly for the bachelor's course.<br><br> At the end of the day, I want to pursue a career in Cyber Security. As I progress through my academic journey, I aim to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to build a successful career in this dynamic and vital field.</p>
